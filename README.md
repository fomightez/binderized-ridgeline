[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fomightez/binderized-ridgeline/master?filepath=index.ipynb)


Based on [this post](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke/status/932764406693482497) by [Claus Wilke](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke) and his code shared in a link there. Does it work in a Binder?

Answer: Yes.  
Using code that was current at the time this was made, you can see the ridlgeline plots first and then the cheese plots below.

Like the colors in this one (and fortunately it specifically references the palette. Yay!):
