Based on [this post](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke/status/932764406693482497) by [Claus Wilke](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke) and his code shared in a link there. Does it work in a Binder?

Answer: Yes.  
Using code that was current at the time this was made, you can see the ridlgeline plots first and then the cheese plots below.
